## About

Welcome to my AICPCoding repository, where I tackle weekly coding challenges from the Artificial Intelligence Community Pakistan (AICP). Here, you'll find my solutions to a variety of problems, demonstrating my problem-solving skills, coding expertise, and grasp of algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

Each weekly challenge is organized into its own dedicated directory, labeled with the week number (e.g., Week 1, Week 2). Inside each directory, you'll discover:

- **Problem Statement:** A detailed description of the challenge.
- **Solution Code:** My code to solve the challenge.
- **Test Cases:** Relevant input-output examples or test cases.

## Goals

Participating in the AICP Challenge serves several goals:

- **Skill Development:** I aim to enhance and test my coding and algorithmic skills through these challenges.
- **Collaboration:** Engaging with the AICP community allows me to learn from peers and share knowledge.
- **Continuous Learning:** Regular participation helps me stay updated with the latest challenges and AI trends.
- **Contribution:** By sharing my solutions and approaches and learning from feedback, I give back to the community.
